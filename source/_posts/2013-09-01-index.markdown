Spring has arrived here in Australia and apocryphally Spring is a time for cleaning away the last vestiges of Winter. In the fourth P2 issue we are not about brushing away winter but stale thoughts. So we take a look at *3D story walls* and wonder if the current state of *build systems* is as good as it can be.

The regulars are all here with *Nick Thorpe* talking to *John Stojanovski* about *viruses*, *Pete* brings in another *comic* and *improve this* returns.

Is there a particular style of article you'd like to see more of? Let us know at p2@thoughtworks.com
