Welcome to the April issue of P2. 

This month we have a rich mix of P2 goodness on offer.

We have another Hardware article to come out of the 100 days of Hardware initiative from India and a couple on problem solving and solutioning at ThoughtWorks. Everything from understanding huge codebases to innovating in the product space. Enjoy!

And as always send your P2 stories to p2@thoughtworks.com. 

Thank you for reading!

Rachel Laycock, Editor in Chief
