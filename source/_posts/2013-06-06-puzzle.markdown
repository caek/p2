This month's coding challenge visits us from the land of Java. What we have is a question of execution order. The first person to respond with the correct answer and why gets their name in the winners circle for next issue.

Exhibit A &mdash; What is the result of this function?

<div class='normal-gist'><script src='https://gist.github.com/distributedlife/5692366.js'></script></div>

Exhibit B &mdash; What is the value of 'value' after this function is executed?

<div class='normal-gist'><script src='https://gist.github.com/distributedlife/5692369.js'></script></div>
