As I write this, I’m thinking about the threads that run through this edition of P2. We don’t plan a theme for each edition, but they do emerge. This time there are two: iterative approaches to software development, and personal stories.

The personal stories sometimes bring some sadness with them. When people move on, or move back home, we miss their stories. We’re bringing you some of these stories in this edition. Stories like how John Stojanovski became interested in security, which will become our first ongoing episodic feature. We also talk to Stewart Gleadow about mobile development, and Andrew Carr about design and the NoPSD movement. Welcome to our second issue of P2 Magazine.

Ryan Boucher, Editor in Chief
