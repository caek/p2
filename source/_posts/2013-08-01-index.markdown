I remember working on project where some team members were dissatisfied with the daily stand-up. They weren’t getting any value of it and struggled to articulate what they did want from it. The team for an iteration held no stand-ups. Afterwards we as a group talked about what information we hadn’t shared with each other that we should have. Stand-up was brought back the following iteration to share just that information.

In the 3rd issue of P2 magazine we pause improve this but look for feedback on whether it should come back. We talk to Musa Kurhula Baloyi about the challenges of Localisation and Digitisation in Africa. Nick Thorpe continues his series with John Stojanovski and John’s history with computer viruses. Ali Lemer talks to Anette Bergo about her experiences of setting up the MelbJS group. All this along with velocityraptors, showcase driven development, a comic and test augmentation make up the August edition of P2 Magazine.
